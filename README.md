# Js-test2
JavaScript's second test
Here we have a total of four functions...in order to run them in VS Code's terminal we type node main.js,
 then press enter.
 1. This function takes in an array with objects, gets the marks average and from that calculates the class average out of a certain total for a test.
 2. This function takes an array with objects, searches for a position using a number given and changes that positions name to a new name given in the function arguments.
 3. This function takes a string of numbers and letters combined and removes from the string just the letters and returns the total sum of the numbers.
 4. This function takes an array of numbers and strings...removes the strings and returns a new array of just numbers including those which were strings converted to numbers.
